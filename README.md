ANDROUX

This project aims to bring capabilities of a linux desktop to your android device. It will be another flavour of linux
which can be used for development use. It gives you freedom of a development machine on your mobile.

As far of now building is only supported on mac osx. Support will soon be added to ubuntu linux, as soon as I fix my 
computer :)
